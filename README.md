# tpope-me

We all know it, some thing you just cannot live without. Such as tpope's vim plugins.

## What is this??

- You have trouble remembering things
- You move to new places all the time and cannot keep moving *you're* configs
- But you're too brittle to live the raw vim-life
- You want peace
- You want freedom
- You want tpope

## What's the easiest way for me to install?

```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kaarmu/tpope-me ~/.vim/plugin/tpope-me
# Or if you want to be very evil
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kaarmu/tpope-me ~/.vim/plugin
```
